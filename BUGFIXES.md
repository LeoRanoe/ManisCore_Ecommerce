# Bug Fixes and Improvements

This document outlines all the bugs and issues that were identified and fixed in the ManisCore E-Commerce platform.

## Summary

All critical bugs have been fixed, and the application now builds and runs successfully without errors. The following issues were identified and resolved:

## Fixed Issues

### 1. ESLint Errors - Unescaped Apostrophes ✅
**Issue**: Multiple files contained unescaped apostrophes which caused ESLint errors.

**Files Affected**:
- `src/app/[company]/contact/page.tsx`
- `src/app/[company]/faqs/page.tsx`
- `src/app/[company]/not-found.tsx`
- `src/app/[company]/page.tsx`
- `src/app/not-found.tsx`

**Solution**: Replaced all apostrophes with the HTML entity `&apos;` to comply with React/JSX best practices.

**Example**:
```tsx
// Before
"We'd love to hear from you!"

// After
"We&apos;d love to hear from you!"
```

### 2. Google Fonts Build Failure ✅
**Issue**: The application was trying to load Google Fonts from an external CDN during build, which failed due to network restrictions. This caused the build process to fail completely.

**Files Affected**:
- `src/app/layout.tsx`
- `tailwind.config.ts`

**Solution**: 
- Removed the Google Fonts import from the layout
- Configured Tailwind CSS to use system fonts as fallback
- Added a comprehensive system font stack that provides excellent typography on all platforms

**Changes**:
```typescript
// layout.tsx - Before
import { Inter } from "next/font/google";
const inter = Inter({ subsets: ["latin"] });
<body className={inter.className}>{children}</body>

// layout.tsx - After
<body className="font-sans antialiased">{children}</body>

// tailwind.config.ts - Added
fontFamily: {
  sans: [
    '-apple-system',
    'BlinkMacSystemFont',
    'Segoe UI',
    'Roboto',
    'Oxygen',
    'Ubuntu',
    'Cantarell',
    'Fira Sans',
    'Droid Sans',
    'Helvetica Neue',
    'sans-serif',
  ],
}
```

### 3. Image Optimization Warning ✅
**Issue**: The application was using the native HTML `<img>` tag instead of Next.js optimized `<Image>` component, resulting in slower load times and performance issues.

**Files Affected**:
- `src/app/[company]/page.tsx`

**Solution**: Replaced `<img>` with Next.js `<Image>` component, which provides automatic image optimization, lazy loading, and better performance.

**Changes**:
```tsx
// Before
<img
  src={testimonial.imageUrl}
  alt={testimonial.name}
  className="w-12 h-12 rounded-full object-cover"
/>

// After
<Image
  src={testimonial.imageUrl}
  alt={testimonial.name}
  width={48}
  height={48}
  className="rounded-full object-cover"
/>
```

### 4. YouTube Iframe Accessibility Issue ✅
**Issue**: The YouTube embed iframe was missing the required `title` attribute, which is essential for screen readers and accessibility compliance.

**Files Affected**:
- `src/components/product/YouTubeEmbed.tsx`

**Solution**: Added a descriptive `title` attribute to the iframe element.

**Changes**:
```tsx
// Before
<iframe
  src={`https://www.youtube.com/embed/${videoId}`}
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowFullScreen
  className="w-full h-full rounded-lg"
/>

// After
<iframe
  src={`https://www.youtube.com/embed/${videoId}`}
  title="Product Review Video"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowFullScreen
  className="w-full h-full rounded-lg"
/>
```

### 5. WhatsApp Phone Number Formatting Bug ✅
**Issue**: The WhatsApp button was not properly sanitizing phone numbers before creating the WhatsApp URL. Phone numbers with spaces, dashes, parentheses, or plus signs could cause the WhatsApp link to fail.

**Files Affected**:
- `src/components/contact/WhatsAppButton.tsx`

**Solution**: Added phone number cleaning logic to remove all special characters before constructing the WhatsApp URL.

**Changes**:
```typescript
// Before
const whatsappUrl = `https://wa.me/${phone}?text=${encodeURIComponent(message)}`;

// After
const cleanPhone = phone.replace(/[\s\-\(\)\+]/g, '');
const whatsappUrl = `https://wa.me/${cleanPhone}?text=${encodeURIComponent(message)}`;
```

This ensures that phone numbers in formats like:
- `+597 123 4567`
- `(597) 123-4567`
- `597-123-4567`

Are all converted to `5971234567` for proper WhatsApp integration.
