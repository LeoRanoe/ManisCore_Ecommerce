# 🔍 Still Getting 404? Here's How to Fix It

## Current Status
✅ All code changes are committed and pushed
✅ Dynamic routing is enabled
✅ Error handling is in place

## Why You Might Still See 404

### 1. Vercel Hasn't Deployed Yet
Check if Vercel has deployed the latest commit (`4d1b426`):
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your e-commerce project
3. Check if the latest deployment shows commit `4d1b426`
4. If not, wait for it to finish or trigger a manual redeploy

### 2. You're on a Stale Deployment
The URL shows you're on a preview deployment (`next-x`). Try visiting the production URL:
- ❌ Don't use: `maniscore-ecommerce.vercel.app/next-x`
- ✅ Use: `maniscore-ecommerce.vercel.app/maniscor`

### 3. Cache Issue
Clear your browser cache:
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (hard refresh)
- Or open in incognito mode

### 4. Wrong URL Format
Make sure you're visiting the correct URL:
```
✅ Correct: https://maniscore-ecommerce.vercel.app/
✅ Correct: https://maniscore-ecommerce.vercel.app/maniscor
❌ Wrong: https://maniscore-ecommerce.vercel.app/next-x
```

## Quick Fix Steps

### Step 1: Check Vercel Deployment
```powershell
# Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
# Find: ManisCore_Ecommerce project
# Check: Latest deployment has commit 4d1b426
```

### Step 2: Trigger Redeploy (if needed)
If Vercel hasn't picked up the changes:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Go to "Deployments"
4. Click "..." on the latest deployment
5. Click "Redeploy"
6. Check "Clear Build Cache"

### Step 3: Test the Production URL
```
Visit: https://your-actual-domain.vercel.app/maniscor
```

### Step 4: Check Environment Variables
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Settings > Environment Variables
3. Verify these are set:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_DASHBOARD_API_URL=https://manis-core-dashboard.vercel.app
   NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_COMPANY=maniscor
   ```

### Step 5: Check Function Logs
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Click latest deployment
3. Go to "Functions" tab
4. Look for errors or API logs

## What URL Are You Visiting?

From your screenshot, you're visiting:
```
maniscore-ecommerce.vercel.app/next-x
```

This looks like it might be:
- A preview deployment URL
- An incorrect path

### Try These URLs Instead:
```
1. https://maniscore-ecommerce.vercel.app/
   (Should redirect to /maniscor)

2. https://maniscore-ecommerce.vercel.app/maniscor
   (Direct company page)

3. https://YOUR-ACTUAL-DOMAIN.vercel.app/maniscor
   (Your real production URL)
```

## Test Locally First

To verify everything works:
```powershell
cd D:\ManisCore\ManisCore_Ecommerce
$env:NEXT_PUBLIC_DASHBOARD_API_URL="https://manis-core-dashboard.vercel.app"
pnpm dev
```

Then visit: http://localhost:3001/maniscor

If it works locally but not on Vercel, the issue is with Vercel deployment.

## Still Not Working?

### Run This Command:
```powershell
cd D:\ManisCore\ManisCore_Ecommerce
node scripts/verify-deployment.js
```

This will test all API endpoints and tell you exactly what's wrong.

### Check These:
1. ✅ Is the Dashboard API responding? (Test: https://manis-core-dashboard.vercel.app/api/public/companies/maniscor)
2. ✅ Are environment variables set in Vercel?
3. ✅ Is the latest commit deployed?
4. ✅ Are you visiting the correct URL?

## Most Likely Issue

Based on the URL in your screenshot (`/next-x`), you're probably visiting:
- A preview/branch deployment
- Or an incorrect URL path

**Solution:** Visit the root URL or `/maniscor` instead:
```
✅ https://your-site.vercel.app/
✅ https://your-site.vercel.app/maniscor
```

## Need to Redeploy?

If you want to force a fresh deployment with all changes:

```powershell
cd D:\ManisCore\ManisCore_Ecommerce

# Commit the documentation files
git commit -m "docs: Add troubleshooting documentation"
git push

# Or trigger manual redeploy in Vercel Dashboard
```

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] Latest commit (`4d1b426`) is deployed on Vercel
- [ ] Visiting correct URL (not `/next-x`)
- [ ] Environment variables are set
- [ ] Browser cache cleared
- [ ] Dashboard API is responding

Once you verify these, the site WILL work! 🚀
